# E-Commerce Churn Prediction Project  

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in an e-commerce setting. The aim is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive steps to retain them, thereby boosting customer loyalty and maximizing profitability.

## **Project Overview**  

### **1. Defining the Problem and Objectives**  

- **Context**:  
  E-commerce platforms rely on transactions for revenue. Customer retention is critical, as churn directly impacts revenue. By predicting customers likely to churn, the business can implement targeted promotions or personalized incentives to mitigate losses.  

- **Problem Formulation**:  
  - How can churn be predicted effectively?  
  - What are the key drivers of churn?  
  - What strategies can reduce churn and retain high-value customers?  

- **Objective**:  
  Build a machine learning model to predict churn, enabling proactive strategies like offering promotions and improving services. The target is binary:  
    - 0: Customer does not churn  
    - 1: Customer churns

### **2. Goals**  

1. Build a Churn Prediction Model to enable targeted marketing and retention strategies.  
2. Identify churn drivers through exploratory data analysis and feature importance.  
3. Design effective retention strategies based on insights from the model.

### **3. Analytical Approach**  

The following steps outline the analytical process:  

1. **Data Understanding**: Collect and explore the dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze patterns, relationships, and potential issues in the data.  
3. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.  
4. **Model Development**: Train baseline and advanced models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models for better performance.  
6. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, and F2 Score to assess performance.  
7. **Explainable ML**: Employ SHAP and LIME for interpretability of model predictions.  
8. **Recommendations**: Propose actionable strategies to reduce churn based on findings.

### **4. Metrics Evaluation**  

- **Primary Metric**: F2 Score  
  - Focus on reducing False Negatives (FN), as they lead to lost customers and revenue.  
  - Maintain reasonable control over False Positives (FP) to optimize promotional costs.  

- **Other Metrics**:  
  - Recall: High priority to capture true churn cases.  
  - Precision: To manage costs effectively.

### **5. Tools and Technologies**  

- **Languages & Libraries**:  
  - Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP, LIME  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:  
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more.  
- **Preprocessing Tools**:  
  - SimpleImputer, IterativeImputer, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
  - GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV  
- **Model Deployment**:  
  - Models saved using `pickle` for future use.
